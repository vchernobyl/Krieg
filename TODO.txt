4. Add support for flipped animations. [DONE]
5. Implement input system to detect key up and key down events. [DONE]
6. Implement hero basic animation changes based on the keyboard input. [DONE]
7. Implement accelerated movement. [DONE]
8. Implement decelerated movement. [DONE]
9. Implement basic jumping. [DONE]

23. Implement support for separate tile set per tile map component. [DONE]
24. Implement basic box collider component. [DONE]
25. Implement physics world that checks collider collisions. [DONE]
26. Add collider drawing. [DONE]
27. Fix box collider position bug when scrolling the camera. [DONE]
28. Add XML parsing library. [DONE]
29. Parse tiled xml map and save tile set data into a struct. [DONE]
30. Parse tiled xml map and save layer data into a struct/class. [DONE]
31. Parse tile ids and create tile structs. [DONE]
32. Render multiple tile map layers. [IN PROGRESS]

?. Add box colliders to the map tiles.
?. Add vector2 as a gravity to the physics world which applies this to the bodies.

Refactor: In SpriteComponent add an overridable GetSourceRect() method that draws section of the texture.
By default it will draw the whole texture.
Refactor: Implement Renderer class which takes care of unprojecting camera and sprite rendering.
Improvement: Add static asserts to check if all components are attached in player states.
Refactor: Implement SpriteDirection instead of AnimDirection and pass that on to animations.
This will allow to hide the implementation details of SDL_RendererFlip and use this enum not only
for animation components but also for sprite components.

How be brutally effective:
--------------------------
1. Get things done quickly
2. Get things done robustly
3. Make things simple
4. Finish things!
