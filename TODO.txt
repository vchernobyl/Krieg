Open Tasks 2021

February:
---------
1. Implement rigidbody physics component to control actors by applying force, where the
   change to the actors position is done by calculating velocity. [DONE]
2. Implement functionality for the animation component to support loading and switching
   of multiple animations. [DONE]
3. Add support for SDL_RendererFlip flag to the SpriteComponent. [DONE]
4. Add support for flipped animations. [DONE]
5. Implement input system to detect key up and key down events. [DONE]
6. Implement hero basic animation changes based on the keyboard input. [DONE]
7. Implement accelerated movement. [DONE]
8. Implement decelerated movement. [DONE]
9. Implement basic jumping. [DONE]

March:
------
1. Fix hero run animation transition. [DONE]
2. Implement non-looping animations. [DONE]
3. Implement method to check if given animation is finished. [DONE]
4. Implement basic jumping animation. [DONE]
5. Add flag to track hero's direction. [DONE]
6. Refactor switch-case state handling into a state wrapper. [DONE]
7. Implement new idle and running state transition. [DONE]
8. Play movement animations based on players velocity. [DONE]
9. Implement jumping state and animation. [DONE]
10. Add static game background component. [DONE]
11. Implement player camera with scrolling. [DONE]
12. Fix jump glitch. [DONE]
13. Fix sprite component draw method to draw at origin instead of the center. [DONE]
14. Basic tile drawing. [DONE]
15. Draw different types of tiles based on the tile id. [DONE]
16. Load csv map from a file. [DONE]
17. Implement tile set class. [DONE]
18. Implement tile map class. [DONE]
19. Refactor csv map loading. [IN PROGRESS]
20. Refactor tile set class. [DONE]

Improvement: Add static asserts to check if all components are attached in player states.
Improvement: Implement SpriteDirection instead of AnimDirection and pass that on to animations.
This will allow to hide the implementation details of SDL_RendererFlip and use this enum not only
for animation components but also for sprite components.

How be brutally effective:
--------------------------
1. Get things done quickly
2. Get things done robustly
3. Make things simple
