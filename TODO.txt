Open Tasks 2021

February:
---------
1. Implement rigidbody physics component to control actors by applying force, where the
   change to the actors position is done by calculating velocity. [DONE]
2. Implement functionality for the animation component to support loading and switching
   of multiple animations. [DONE]
3. Add support for SDL_RendererFlip flag to the SpriteComponent. [DONE]
4. Add support for flipped animations. [DONE]
5. Implement input system to detect key up and key down events. [DONE]
6. Implement hero basic animation changes based on the keyboard input. [DONE]
7. Implement accelerated movement. [DONE]
8. Implement decelerated movement. [DONE]
9. Implement basic jumping. [DONE]

March:
------
1. Fix hero run animation transition. [DONE]
2. Implement non-looping animations. [DONE]
3. Implement jumping animation.
4. Implement falling animation.

(?) Improvement: Implement SpriteDirection instead of AnimDirection and pass that on to animations.
This will allow to hide the implementation details of SDL_RendererFlip and use this enum not only
for animation components but also for sprite components.

How be brutally effective:
--------------------------
1. Get things done quickly
2. Get things done robustly
3. Make things simple
